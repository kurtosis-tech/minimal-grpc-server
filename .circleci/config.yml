          # - Without the '--no-pager' flag, Git will print "WARNING: Terminal is not fully functional" and not display any output
          # - Circle has no way of getting the PR base branch, so we have to hardcode develop :( See: https://ideas.circleci.com/cloud-feature-requests/p/provide-env-variable-for-branch-name-targeted-by-pull-request
          # - The --exit-code flag to git-diff returns 0 on no changes, 1 on changes
          # - We have to use 'origin/develop' rather than 'develop' because Circle does a shallow checkout, and 'develop' gets set to something weird and wrong that makes the check buggy

# NOTE: Because CircleCI jobs run on separate machines from each other, we duplicate steps (like checkout) between jobs. This is because doing the "correct" DRY
#  refactoring of, "one job for checkout, one job for build Docker image, etc." would require a) persisting files between jobs and b) persisting Docker images between
#  jobs. Both are annoying (saving/loading workspaces require re-downloading the workspace over the network, and there doesn't seem to be a good way to do Docker
#  images), so we run everything inside a single job.
# See also: https://discuss.circleci.com/t/can-docker-images-be-preserved-between-jobs-in-a-workflow-without-a-manual-load-save/23388/12
